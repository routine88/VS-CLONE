# MVP Readiness Report

## Owner Sentiment Snapshot
The project owner is increasingly frustrated that, despite substantial design documentation and technical scaffolding, there is still no playable minimum viable product (MVP). Major points of frustration include:
- **Lack of tangible progress:** Without a playable build, stakeholders cannot validate the game loop, pacing, or feel, making it difficult to secure confidence and external buy-in.
- **Diffuse efforts:** Work has remained spread across documentation and broad systems planning rather than converging on a focused vertical slice.
- **Slipping morale and timelines:** Each week without a playable milestone erodes morale, increases perceived risk, and threatens the production roadmap outlined in the PRD.

## Fastest Path to a Playable MVP
To reach a “controller-in-hand” prototype as quickly as possible, focus on the narrowest viable slice that exercises the core loop once.

1. **Lock Scope to a Single Arena Run**
   - Graveyard biome only, with a single scrolling lane and minimal environmental interaction.
   - One hunter (default loadout) with a single auto-firing weapon and one upgrade choice to demonstrate progression.

2. **Implement Barebones Enemy Cadence**
   - Two enemy archetypes (swarm and bruiser) with simplified AI that pursues the player horizontally.
   - Timed spawn ramps over a five-minute session; treat miniboss and ultimate systems as out-of-scope.

3. **Minimal Progression Loop**
   - Collectible soul shards that increment experience.
   - Level-up prompt offering a single upgrade (damage or fire-rate modifier) to show growth.

4. **Core Player Feel**
   - Responsive left/right movement, dash, and collision resolution.
   - Basic damage handling with a single health bar and fail state.

5. **Temporary Art & Audio**
   - Use programmer art sprites and placeholder SFX to keep iteration fast.
   - Integrate debug overlays to monitor spawn rates and performance.

6. **Rapid Build Pipeline**
   - Establish a Unity prototype project with automated builds (editor play mode is acceptable for the MVP checkpoint).
   - Daily smoke-test checklist covering input, spawning, upgrades, and failure condition.

## Next Tasks to Reach MVP State
1. **Create Unity prototype project** configured with 2D URP template and repo structure for prototype scenes and scripts.
2. **Implement player controller** handling movement, dash, health, and collision in the prototype scene.
3. **Set up enemy spawner** with two enemy prefabs, simple chase AI, and timed spawn escalation.
4. **Add experience and upgrade flow** including soul shard pickups, XP thresholds, and one upgrade option UI.
5. **Wire placeholder art/audio** leveraging simple sprites, tilemap background, and temporary sound cues.
6. **Publish daily build notes** capturing regressions, feel adjustments, and outstanding blockers until MVP is confirmed playable.

Aligning on this narrow path keeps the team laser-focused on the essential experience that demonstrates Nightfall Survivors’ promise while minimizing time spent on secondary systems.
