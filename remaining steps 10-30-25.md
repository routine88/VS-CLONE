### Repository snapshot
* The repo presently packages the paper design, production roadmap, and multiple Python prototypes: a deterministic text simulation, an interactive terminal slice, and a Tk-based viewer, alongside tooling to export frame data for downstream clients.
* Concept-validation deliverables listed in the roadmap—design documentation, gameplay sandbox, graphics layer, and Unity export schema—are all marked complete, confirming the project has cleared its initial prototyping gate.

### Remaining work toward full launch
* **Vertical slice completion.** Core production features described in the PRD—fully realized Graveyard biome, two launch hunters, four upgradeable weapons, synced audio cues, and asset parity between the Python viewer and the Unity client—still need to be implemented to hit the 12-week slice milestone.
* **Content expansion.** Launch scope calls for additional biomes, a complete glyph and relic catalog, advanced enemy behaviors (ceiling clingers, ranged variants), and the full meta-progression loop with persistent profiles, all of which remain unchecked on the roadmap.
* **Polish and launch prep.** Pre-launch requirements—performance optimization, multi-language localization, comprehensive QA planning, marketing assets, Steam page setup, demo/EA branch management, and live-ops scheduling—are open items before Early Access release.
* **Engineering, art, and audio pipeline.** Packaging the Python toolchain, generating automated performance telemetry, delivering a Unity importer sample, and producing placeholder/final art and SFX/music assets are outstanding checklist tasks.

### Unity integration approach
* The Python side already serializes render and audio frames into deterministic JSON bundles via `game.export.UnityFrameExporter`, emitting sprite transforms, audio triggers, and metadata required for a client renderer.
* `docs/UNITY_BRIDGE.md` specifies the data contract (fields for render/audio instructions, asset descriptors) and prescribes the Unity runtime loop: polling exported frames, resolving sprite/audio assets, updating pooled GameObjects, and feeding back telemetry once applied.
* Integration steps therefore include: (1) standing up the Unity 2022 LTS project with URP, (2) writing the JSON importer that mirrors the documented schema, (3) mapping sprite/audio IDs to placeholder or final assets, (4) implementing the frame-application loop using the guidance above, and (5) expanding tests or editor tools to validate payload compatibility. Roadmap entries highlight that the Unity importer, asset parity, and playback loop are still pending deliverables.
